Project from CodeCademy.com. Decided to challenge myself and write it without following the steps and I did it! 

Some Ideas with this going forward:
* Build into webUI and see about implementing gambling feature for a crypto gambling website.

* Add repeat feature so the game doesn't end on the first round.
